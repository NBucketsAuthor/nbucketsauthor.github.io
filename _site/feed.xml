In case you’re visiting it in the not so near future,
it hopefully looks richer than that.</p>

<h3 id="who">Who?</h3>

<p>Nick Buckets, crime fiction author. <a href="http://localhost:4000/#about">Have we already met?</a></p>

<h3 id="what">What?</h3>
<p>Stuff that doesn’t belong to a book, a collection of stories, or anything similar. These are mostly
ideas &amp; comments about reading &amp; writing, sometimes including data visualization, code etc.</p>

<h3 id="when">When?</h3>

<p>Here’s our contract: I’m going to post irregularly, most likely sparsely, and only when I feel I have
something to write down.</p>

<h3 id="where">Where?</h3>

<p>Rgiht here.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<p>I know what you’re thinking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Writing books is already hard. Why start a blog on top of that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, why not?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because blogs are so out of fashion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are. But then again, so is everything else in life sooner or later, isn’t it?</p>

<h3 id="anything-else">Anything else?</h3>

<p>In case you arrived here from a search engine, feel free to navigate to my main page and check out 
my books.</p>

<p>Oh, and I love feedback. If you read any of my books, let me know how you liked them.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="uninformative" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to yet another blog]]></summary></entry></feed>
