# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: Nick spent ample time in theoretical physics before jumping into life sciences
  so that he can be closer to his other half. When not writing crime fiction, he punches numbers
  behind a computer screen. Originally from Athens, Nick now lives with his wife in Berlin.
