                        In the bustling metropolis of Berlin, homicide detective Olaf Bauer struggles 
                        with the aftermath of a shootout. An organ trafficking gang claimed his partner’s 
                        life, and Olaf holds himself responsible. So when a young woman is murdered with 
                        her ovaries missing, he can’t shake the feeling his partner died for nothing.

                        Olaf’s boss assigns him a new partner for the investigation: Julia Teichmann,
                        a sharp-witted divorcee with a young daughter and a fiery temperament. As Olaf 
                        and Julia are adjusting to working together, a second murder occurs. The same 
                        gruesome signature is present, and the duo soon realizes they’re dealing with 
                        a serial killer.

                        With the clock ticking, Olaf and Julia will confront their own family histories 
                        to uncover the killer’s identity. But in the absence of clear motives and leads, 
                        the perpetrator could be anyone. Will they crack the case and put the killer 
                        behind bars, or will they fall prey to the deadly game?
