                        In the bustling metropolis of Berlin, a young woman is brutally murdered and her ovaries are missing.

                        Homicide detective Olaf Bauer, still haunted by the loss of his partner to an organ trafficking gang, teams up with Julia Teichmann, a recent divorcée with a daughter and her own demons, to lead the investigation.

                        As Olaf and Julia adjust to working together, a second murder mimicking the first occurs, and the killer could be anyone—even Julia’s own father.

                    <p>Who is behind the serial gruesome murders?</p>
                    <p>And how is Olaf’s brother tangled up in the case?</p>
