                        Homicide detective Olaf Bauer never saw his brother’s quick return to the 
                        streets of Berlin coming. After putting Max behind bars, Olaf believed 
                        that chapter was closed for good. But when his brother exploits a legal 
                        loophole to walk free, their shared past storms back as Max threatens to 
                        end him.

                        Complicating matters further, Olaf is handed an unusual case of a 
                        journalist’s death. Digging deeper, Olaf unearths troubling links 
                        between the murder, Max’s reappearance, and the kidnapping of a 
                        prominent politician. The plot thickens as a slick lawyer, an 
                        enigmatic pub owner, a morally ambiguous university professor, and 
                        a caring hospice nurse all emerge as pieces in the same twisted puzzle.

                        What went down with them two decades ago?  <br>
                        And how do the dots connect in the current circus?
