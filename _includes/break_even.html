                        <b>Detective Olaf Bauer thought he’d seen the last of his brother when 
                            he put him behind bars.</b> But when a legal loophole sets Max free, 
                            their violent past comes roaring back to life.

                        To complicate matters, Olaf takes on a puzzling murder case. Digging deeper, he 
                        unearths disturbing links between a dead journalist, Max’s release, and a politician’s 
                        disappearance.

                        <b>Four key figures emerge as pieces in the puzzle:</b> a cunning lawyer, 
                        an enigmatic pub owner, a morally conflicted professor, and a hospice nurse 
                        carrying an unexpected burden.
