This is how my website looked like when I kicked-off this blog. In case you're visiting it in the not so near future,
it hopefully looks richer than that.

### Who?

Nick Buckets, crime fiction author. [Have we already met?]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/#about)

### What?
Stuff that doesn't belong to a book, a collection of stories, or anything similar. These are mostly
ideas & comments about reading & writing, sometimes including data visualization, code etc.

### When?

Here's our contract: I'm going to post irregularly, most likely sparsely, and only when I feel I have
something to write down.

### Where?

Right here.

### Why?

I know what you're thinking:

> Writing books is already hard. Why start a blog on top of that?

Well, why not?

> Because blogs are so out of fashion

They are. But then again, so is everything else in life sooner or later, isn't it?

### Anything else?

In case you arrived here from a search engine, feel free to navigate to my main page and check out 
my books.

Oh, and I love feedback. If you read any of my books, let me know how you liked them.
