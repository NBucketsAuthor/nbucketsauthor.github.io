                    Detective Olaf Bauer thought he’d buried his demons. But when a woman is found
                    murdered, with her ovaries removed, old wounds are ripped open.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Back from furlough, he's paired with a new partner: Julia Teichmann, a 
                        razor-sharp single mom with her own battles to fight.

                        As Olaf and Julia adjust to working together, another body drops. Same 
                        ritual. Same sick signature.

                    <p>
                        With the clock ticking, Olaf and Julia must confront their own troubled 
                        families while hunting a killer who could be anyone—even someone close to home.
