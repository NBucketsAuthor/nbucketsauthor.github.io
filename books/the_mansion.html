                        Rookie detective Olaf Bauer is thrown into a nightmare when a grisly
                        murder scene is discovered inside an empty house in the heart of Berlin.

                        For years, the Mansion has been plagued by rumors of dark rituals and death,
                        making it impossible to sell. Now, as a real estate agent stumbles upon multiple
                        bodies within its walls, local hearsay becomes a chilling reality.
                    </p>

                        <b>Is she as innocent as she claims?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the house begins to cloud Olafâ€™s judgment, the lines between reality and paranoia 
                        blur. With his mind cracking and his more experienced partner doubting his every 
                        move, Olaf must fight not only to solve the case but to keep his grip on sanity.
